# Publishes one test report bundle to the test-reports branch.
#
# The branch holds one file per run, pr/<number>/<run id>.json, and one index
# per pull request, pr/<number>/index.json. The branch has no history worth
# keeping and no code, so this script never rebases: when a push loses a race
# against the run of another pull request, it fetches the new tip, applies the
# files again on top of it, and pushes again. The files of a run are only
# added or replaced, so a retry is safe.
#
# Environment:
#   REPO_URL     the repository, with credentials for a push
#   BUNDLE       path of the bundle to publish
#   PR_NUMBER    the pull request
#   RUN_ID       the workflow run; names the file
#   TESTED_SHA   the commit that was tested; named in the commit message
#   BRANCH       the branch, default test-reports
#   WORKDIR      an empty or absent directory to clone into, default reports
#   SCRIPTS_DIR  where report-index.js lives, default beside this script
#   ATTEMPTS     push attempts, default 3
#
# Writes report_path=pr/<number>/<run id>.json to GITHUB_OUTPUT when set.

# Test reports

This branch is written by the Descriptor Test Results workflow. Do not edit it by hand, and do not base work on it: it has no shared history with `master`, and it can be recreated from scratch at any time.

Each run of the Descriptor Tests workflow on a pull request adds one bundle, and updates the index of that pull request:

```
pr/<pull request number>/<run id>.json   the bundle of one run
pr/<pull request number>/index.json      the runs of the pull request, newest first
```

The bundle format is documented in `.github/test-runner-docs/bundle.md` on `master`. The test report viewer reads the files from `raw.githubusercontent.com`.
